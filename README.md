## 📌 Overview of the Project

**Project:** RESTFUL API DEVELOPMENT  
This project involves building a simple and scalable RESTful API using Node.js and Express. The API manages product data with full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality, following RESTful best practices and conventions.

The goal is to provide a backend service that can be consumed by frontend applications or other services, with clean code organization and clear API documentation.

## 💡 Features

- **CRUD Operations**: Create, read, update, and delete products.
- **RESTful Endpoints**: Proper use of HTTP methods and resource-based URLs.
- **JSON Format**: All requests and responses use JSON.
- **Error Handling**: Returns appropriate HTTP status codes and messages.
- **Modular Code Structure**: Separate routes, controllers, and models.
- **Lightweight**: Minimal dependencies for easy setup and maintenance.
